**Hi, I'm Jon!**

* I'm a **Game Programmer**, where I currently work for **Pokemon**.
* I enter **Ludum Dare** every now and then, you can find my entries on [itch.io](https://nuclearfriend.itch.io).
* I'm currently making a fast paced action game called **turbosnake**.

I created this site to basically host a blog, I wanted to do a bit of long form writing on some things, really just for me, but if you found anything useful in here that's cool too.
