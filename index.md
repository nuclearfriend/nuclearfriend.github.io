**Hi, I'm Jon!**

* I'm a **Game Programmer**, where I currently work for **Pokemon**
* I participate in game jams every once in a full moon, particularly **Ludum Dare**! You can find my entries on [itch.io](https://nuclearfriend.itch.io)
* I'm currently building an intense action game called **turbosnake**

I created this site to basically host a blog, I wanted to do a bit of long form writing on some things, really just for me, but if you found anything useful in here that's cool too!
